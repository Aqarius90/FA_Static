By this standard,\n      the receiver will know there is a message waiting for them from the\n      sender.\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"card\">\n      <div class=\"card-body\">\n        <em>“ASL, A1.”</em> (Hearing this, Alpha SL now knows the FTL of Alpha 1\n        is calling them.)\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <h4>\n      <br />\n      Acknowledgement\n    </h4>\n    <p>\n      The number one task of anybody sending a message is making sure they have\n      the target’s attention.
