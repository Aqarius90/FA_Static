The\r\n      Platoon, led by a CO, consists of three Squads, led by SLs, each made up\r\n      of two Fireteams, led by FTLs.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>\r\n        Oh, well, obviously. But let's pretend for a moment that I didn't\r\n        understand a word of that...\r\n      </b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      You'll figure it out the minute you see it in action. If you're 100% new\r\n      to this, my advice would be to grab one of the 'riflemen' slots. You can\r\n      even ask the host to save you one. It's a perfect position to see how the\r\n      system works, and it takes no prior knowledge past \"listen to your leader\"\r\n      and \"point and shoot\".\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>Right. But suppose I still wanna hear the details?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Allrighty then:</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>Fire and Maneuver?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Exactly. One team <font color=\"blue\">suppresses the enemy</font> (so they\r\n      can't shoot back), and then the other team{\" \"}\r\n      <font color=\"red\">moves in</font> for the kill.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>So, if I'm not an SL or FTL...</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      You generally don't talk on TS. Unless there's something really, really\r\n      urgent.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>\r\n        <u>Infantry</u> squad. There are other kinds?\r\n      </b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Very observant! There is, indeed, a mechanized squad. Basically, the mech.\r\n      squad trades one fireteam for an armored transport/fire support vehicle.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>Wait, what are 'attachments'?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Attachments are typically 2-man elements (spotter and gunner) that can be\r\n      used to add a specific type of special weapon to the platoon. For example,\r\n      the Heavy AntiTank (HAT) team adds, as the name suggests, a heavy AT\r\n      weapon. An MMG team adds a medium machinegun, which is bigger than what\r\n      the automatic riflemen have. A mortar team, well, you get the picture.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>So, where do they fit on the diagram?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Wherever the CO wants them. When attached to a squad, the Attachment lead\r\n      (the 'spotter') talks on TS. When attached directly to CO, they speak on\r\n      Channel commander.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>Wait, wait, back up: what's \"Channel Commander\"?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Oh, right, that thing. Well, CC is a TeamSpeak feature that lets you talk\r\n      to people outside of your channel. We use it for comms 'one level up' from\r\n      TS. You can more or less ignore it unless you slot as an element lead. or\r\n      your lead gets shot and you have to take over.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>And if that happens?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I am glad you asked! Proceed right down this hatch for your comms\r\n      training:\r\n    </p>\r\n  </TrainingLayout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Platoon\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
