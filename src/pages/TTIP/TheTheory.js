    <h3>The Mission</h3>
    <p>
      A typical Folk ARPS mission has the players faced with a task, and an
      opposing force that tries to prevent them from accomplishing the task.
      This conflict is usually played out through moving to contact, at which
      point the sides engage in a firefight.{" "}
    </p>

    <p>
      On the most basic level, you need to move to do anything, and getting shot
      makes it hard to move, or shoot, or do anything else, really. Thus, once
      the shooting begins, the first job you have, if at all possible to do so,
      is to <b>establish fire superiority</b>. If you are sending more lead
      their way than they are sending your way, the opponent’s task becomes
      increasingly difficult. Once you have denied the enemy the capability of
      moving and shooting, you are free to either assault and finish them off,
      or disengage and move on.
    </p>

    <p>The core principles here are that of Fire and Maneuver:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Getting shot at makes it hard to do things, since leaving cover is
        dangerous.
      </li>
      <li>
        Getting shot at makes it hard to move, since leaving cover is dangerous.
      </li>
      <li>
        Getting shot at makes it more difficult to shoot back, as aiming and
        firing require you to expose yourself to enemy fire.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>From this follows that action is enabled by fire.</p>

    <p>
      Take note: It is not just about getting shot, but also getting shot at. In
      the initial stage of the fight, it’s not required to kill the enemy
      (strictly speaking), as long as your shots are frequent and close enough
      that the enemy believes he will be killed if he takes action.
