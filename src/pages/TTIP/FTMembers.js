    <h3>Fireteam Members</h3>

    <p>
      Each role in the fireteam is integral to its performance. Putting in the
      effort of fulfilling your role goes a long way to minimise casualties. FA
      does not use respawn. It helps with tone, but it sucks if you get shot 5
      minutes into an hour long mission. Doing your part helps keep the team
      working, and keep the team alive. Remember, you're not going to win it
      alone.
    </p>

    <h4>Rifleman (R)</h4>
    <p>
      The basic member of the fireteam is the rifleman (if you're new, or unsure
      of how things work, slotting as a rifleman is a safe option).
    </p>
    <p>
      The rifleman's job is to contribute to the effectiveness of the team as a
      whole. They are an extra set of eyes, an extra gun, and an extra backpack
      to share the load of the team. If you are a rifleman, these are your basic
      responsibilities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Stick to Your Team</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Follow your FTL or someone in your team.</li>
          <li>
            Listen to your FTL. They are in charge of your team, and will direct
            you to make best use of your capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unless directed otherwise by the FTL, stay with your colour team
            (usually Red).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Maintain Awareness</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Know where you are, where the rest of your team is, and if possible,
            where the rest of the platoon is. Knowing where your friends are
            will make it less likely you will shoot them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cover a Sector</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Consider where the rest of the team is facing, and if there is a
            direction uncovered, watch that way. If you see anything important,
            report it to your FTL.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Carry the Team’s Gear</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As a rule, riflemen carry spare ammo for RAT and ARs. Be ready to
            provide it.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a RAT or AR in your team dies, it's often a good idea to recover
            their weapon. AT assets in particular can sometimes make or break
            the team’s progress.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Rifleman Anti-Tank (RAT)</h4>
    <p>
      In addition to the basic rifleman duties, the RAT is tasked with manning
      the team's AT tube. As such, in the role of RAT, you will also be expected
      to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Listen to Your FTL</b>
        <ul>
          The AT launcher may be in your care, but it’s not a personal weapon –
          It’s a team asset. The FTL will direct your fire, and may be able to
          range your shots.
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Maintain Awareness of Squad Communications</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If a vehicle is reported within your range or approaching your
            position, it's a good idea to prepare your launcher.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Know Your Gear</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Familiarize yourself with AT launchers, in particular the M3 MAAWS
            and RPG42. You will have the opportunity to test them out in the
            presession.
          </li>
          <li>
            By default, the fireteam has 5 rockets at its disposal, 3 with you,
            and one with each R. Keep track of these, and inform your FTL if
            you’re running low.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Automatic Rifleman (AR)</h4>
    <p>
      The automatic rifleman replaces their standard rifle with an Automatic
      Rifle, capable of sustained fire, and sporting a bipod. Also, if (hah,
      "if") the FTL dies, the role of unit commander passes on to the AR below
      them. In accordance, as an AR, you will be expected to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Listen to Your FTL</b>
        <li>
          They will try to position you in the most effective spot to engage an
          enemy or defend the team, and direct your fire if need be.The
          automatic rifle may be in your care, but is primarily a team asset
          (technically, your personal weapon is your sidearm).
        </li>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Maintain Awareness</b>
        <li>
          There are two ARs in your colour team, some situations require both of
          you to look the same way, but in light contact you can split
          responsibilities and cover a sector the other AR is not covering.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay attention to cover around you on which you can deploy your bipod,
          and let your FTL know if the spot is unsuitable or there is a better
          alternative.
        </li>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Know Your Gear</b>
        <li>
          Keep track of your ammo, as well as the extra belts the Rs have for
          you. You'd be surprised how fast the ammo runs out when you're hosing
          down the enemy.
        </li>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Speaking of... </b>
        <li>
          Cackle to yourself, and hose down the enemy. <br />
          <br />
          ...I mean, we're all thinking it, right?
        </li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Fireteam Leader (FTL)</h4>
    <p>
      Often the most demanding role in Folk ARPS. The FTL is all at once a
      rifleman, grenadier, radio operator, and team lead. The FTL's job is to
      take orders from above, and turn them into reality (or a reasonable
      approximation) using their team. Some tips on this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Read the Briefing</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            FTLs are the ones executing the plan laid out by the SL. How can one
            execute the plan if they don’t know it? Read the briefing to avoid
            unnecessary deaths and delays.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Listen to Your SL</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Respond and act upon the SL's orders. A quick voice confirmation,
            such as ''A1 Copies,'' goes a long way to reducing headaches.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>No, Really. Listen to Your SL</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Respond and act upon the SL's orders promptly. Your SL has given you
            a task and is relying on you. If you're not where they need you to
            be, someone else needs to cover that gap.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keeping the gap short between an order given and its acknowledgement
            aids the squad’s momentum.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Maintain Awareness of Leadership</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You should read the briefing in any case, but if you're
            FTL, it's vital. Not only do you need to be ready to replace the SL
            if (hah, "if") he goes down, you need to know the briefing in order
            to properly interpret the intent of the orders you are getting, and
            how to put them into action.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Talk to Your SL</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep the SL informed of threats your team spots or is engaging, the
            status of your team, and any other information you feel is relevant.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Talk to Your Team</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep your team members informed. They may or may not hear what the
            SL says over comms, but they are not meant to move or shoot before
            your instructions. You are the one in charge of them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lead Your Team</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It's up to you to manage your subordinates, which means being
            familiar with their roles, their capabilities, and the best ways to
            put them to use. Keep track of your people, and, if they go down,
            their weapons. Keep track of and manage the team's ammo status.
            Also, try and keep track of if they need a medic or not.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Know Your Gear</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your rangefinder is often more important than your rifle. The
            rangefinder can not only spot targets from afar, but also provide a
            precise range for your RAT, your ARs, or for more accurate map
            markers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The grenade launcher makes you capable of indirect fire, and, much
            more importantly, able to lay long-distance smoke before an advance.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Squad Leader (SL)</h4>
    <p>
      Deserves a mention here despite technically not being a fireteam member.
      As SL, your role is not to command your fireteams. Your role is to command
      your fireteam leaders. If there is a Commanding Officer above you, you
      interpret and implement their orders. Otherwise, you are also the CO. Your
      role is less about directly engaging with the fight, and more about
      enabling your subordinates to maximise their effectiveness. Some tips on
      this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Read the Briefing</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Familiarize yourself with the mission conditions, objectives, local
            terrain, enemy forces, friendly forces, and anything else of note.
            This shouldn’t even need to be mentioned, yet here we are.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Maintain Communications</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep your FTLs informed of contacts and other information reported
            by other squads, and keep the other squads informed of contacts and
            other information reported by your FTLs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Maintain Cohesion</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You need to be close enough to the frontline to understand the
            conditions your fireteams are in and make informed decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your fireteams are <b>not independent of each other</b>. Make sure
            they’re positioned to support each other adequately. Riflemen are
            generally effective out to 300m. Without the element of surprise on
            either side, most contact occurs within 200m or much less.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lead Your Squad</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your fireteams <b>are independent from you</b>. Trust your FTLs to
            direct their teams. Give them a task, and let them do it.
            Micromanagement is detrimental to mission accomplishment.
          </li>
          <li>
            During lulls, give your squad detailed information about what to
            expect ahead, how to pace themselves, and make sure your FTLs
            provide status reports of their manpower and ammo. In a firefight,
            if you have positioned your FTLs right, they should be able to
            coordinate their teams fire effectively.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Remember: you're not controlling AI units, your units are humans directing
      other humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your leaders will need time to interpret and act upon your directions. Be
      clear, be brief, and don't give more orders than your subordinates can
      keep up with.
    </p>
