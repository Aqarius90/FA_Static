    <h4>This is not a looter shooter.</h4>

    <p>
      <em>
        ''If the Corps had meant for us to have two RATs, they would'ha issued
        them at slotting. If the Good Lord had meant for us to wear hex camo,
        she would'ha made us be born CSAT.''

      Comrade Prime Minister Netkev, probably.

    <p>
      Do not recover your team's assets if there is a more suitable team member
      (e.g. a R should pick up an AT tube before an AR does).
      <br />
      Do not recover another team's assets unless ordered to (their assets -
      their responsibility).
      <br />
      Do not slow the team down to grab ammo (grabbing FAKs, smokes, grenades,
      and extra ammo for your gun is fine, but there's a time and a place).
      <br />
      Absolutely do not pick up any equipment that does not pertain to the role
      you're slotting as, unless explicitly directed by your commander. If in
      doubt, don't.
      <br />
      If you still end up taking over "exotic" assets, let people know.
      Otherwise, you will be mistaken for the enemy, and you will get shot.
    </p>

    <h4>Be Cooperative</h4>
    <p>
      You may be able to accomplish a variety of tasks yourself, but itâ€™s not a
      competition. You should strive to maximize the fun of those around you,
      most of all by not causing them undue problems.
    </p>

    <h4>Slots are Voluntary</h4>
    <p>
      We don't do backseat driving.
      <br />
      If you didn't take a leadership slot, then you are not a leader.
      <br />
      If you would like to be a leader, slot as one.
      <br />
      If you have comments or suggestions, feel free to discuss them in the AAR,
      or grab the leadership slot next time and do it yourself. If you
      absolutely must voice your opinion, do it respectfully, and keep in mind
      that the lead's order is still final.
