        I really liked the presentation so far, but I don't think I'm quite
        ready to hop on just yet. I was thinking maybe I'll... wait, why are you
        handing me a backpack?
      </b>

    <p>
      That's your ammo backpack. Your uniform, map, and compass are also inside.

      <b>Where the hell are we?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Supply depot, naturally! Where else to we get you your equipment? Oh, and
      here's your helmet.

      </b>
    </p>
    <p>Of course. And your trusty AK is waiting inside!</p>
    <p>
