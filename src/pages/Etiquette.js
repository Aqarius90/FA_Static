    <h3>Etiquette</h3>
    <p>
      <b>
        So, what <em>is</em> the etiquette?
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We ask that every comrade observes a few very simple principles with
      regard to communications, gameplay and banter:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Slotting: During this phase please don't talk on TS and listen carefully
        to the host's instructions. Please use SideChat for questions and
        banter.
      </li>

      <li>
        Briefing: During this phase please don't talk on TS and listen carefully
        to the CO's instructions. Please use SideChat for banter. Importantly,
        we don't plan by committee: critiques and alternative plans belong in
        the session's AAR thread.
      </li>

      <li>
        In-Game: Simply remember that one person's witty banter can be another's
        frustrating distraction. Some banter on VON is fine, but if an element
        leader asks you to hush for a bit, please do so.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>That seems reasonable. What about during gameplay?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do only one thing, simply to follow the orders of your element
      leader and avoid lone-wolfing. Beyond that, we like to respect the design
      of each scenario and play the parts we have selected during slotting:
      unless ordered to, please don't scavenge for fancy/different weapons or
      vehicles not relevant to your role. Non-regulation gear tends to attract
      friendly fire and falling submarines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What?!?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevermind. Just follow the etiquette and keep the banter to chat during
      planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Is, uh, is there an etiquette guide for banter?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Just one rule: please don't use humour that is at the expense of any group
      of people, be it defined by gender, race, sexual orientation, nationality,
      political views etc. At FA, everyone is welcome - because we all strive to
      ensure nobody feels unwelcome. We're sure you already know that outright
      sexism, racism, homophobia etc. are unacceptable here (as in many
      communities) - we just ask that when you crack a joke or make a witty
      comment, you consider first whether it will make someone feel unwelcome.
      If your remark boils down to 'lol, gay'/'lol, swedes'/'lol, rape', then
      it's just not our kind of banter. This applies not only to 'Banter'
      banter, but to any and all FA comms channels, be it forums, Discord, or
      party-approved carrier pigeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        But what if me and my friend have this in-joke that s/he doesn't find
        offensive at all, even though it's about Swedes and Australians and sex?
        Isn't this all a bit Social Justice Warrior?
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that anyone can participate in our sessions - new comrades might
      not understand that you're friends, and may feel uncomfortable enough not
      to come back - which would be a shame for you, them and everyone who works
      hard to make the sessions happen. This isn't about politics for us, it's
      about ensuring that FA is a community where absolutely anyone can come and
      enjoy some tactical ArmA. Even sex-loving Swedes and Australians.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        Ah ... yeah, that makes sense now that you put it that way. So what
        happens if someone says something that makes me uncomfortable?
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Contact any of the hosts and they'll do all they can to resolve the
      situation. Hopefully without having to use a Party-issued Makarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>So, basically, don't be a dick?</b>
    </p>
    <p>Basically.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Anything else I should know?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am glad you asked! Step right on through this bunker for the
      organisational briefing:
