Putting in the\r\n      effort of fulfilling your role goes a long way to minimise casualties. FA\r\n      does not use respawn. It helps with tone, but it sucks if you get shot 5\r\n      minutes into an hour long mission. Doing your part helps keep the team\r\n      working, and keep the team alive.

Also, if (hah,\r\n      \"if\") the FTL dies, the role of unit commander passes on to the AR below\r\n      him. In accordance, as an AR, you will be expected to:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <b>Listen to Your FTL</b>\r\n        <li>\r\n          They will try to position you in the most effective spot to engage an\r\n          enemy or defend the team, and direct your fire if need be.The\r\n          automatic rifle may be in your care, but is primarily a team asset\r\n          (technically, your personal weapon is your sidearm).\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <b>Maintain Awareness</b>\r\n        <li>\r\n          There are two ARs in your colour team, some situations require both of\r\n          you to look the same way, but in light contact you can split\r\n          responsibilities and cover a sector the other AR is not covering.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Pay attention to cover around you on which you can deploy your bipod,\r\n          and let your FTL know if the spot is unsuitable or there is a better\r\n          alternative.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <b>Know Your Gear</b>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Keep track of your ammo, as well as the extra belts the Rs have for\r\n          you.

The FTL is all at once a\r\n      rifleman, grenadier, radio operator, and team lead. The FTL's job is to\r\n      take orders from above, and turn them into reality (or a reasonable\r\n      approximation) using his team.

Keep track of your people, and, if they go down,\r\n            their weapons.

Your role is to command\r\n      your fireteam leaders. If there is a Commanding Officer above you, you\r\n      interpret and implement his orders. Otherwise, you are also the CO. Your\r\n      role is less about directly engaging with the fight, and more about\r\n      enabling your subordinates to maximise their effectiveness.

In a firefight,\r\n            if you have positioned your FTLs right, they should be able to\r\n            coordinate their teams fire effectively.\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Remember: you're not controlling AI units, your units are humans directing\r\n      other humans.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Your leaders will need time to interpret and act upon your directions.
