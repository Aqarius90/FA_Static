squads, and assorted weapons teams.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        The <em>FA squad</em> is made up of the command element, and either two\n        fireteams, or a fireteam and their dedicated mechanized transport.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        The <em>FA fireteam</em> is made up of two elements (color-coded for\n        your convenience):\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            The <font color=\"blue\">fire</font> element, consisting of:\n            <ul>\n              <li>A Fireteam Leader (FTL)</li>\n              <li>2x Automatic Riflemen (AR)</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            The <font color=\"red\">maneuver</font> element, consisting of:\n            <ul>\n              <li>An Anti-Tank Rifleman (RAT)</li>\n              <li>2x Riflemen (R)</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>\n      As we can see, the fireteam is made up of two asymmetric parts, intended\n      to facilitate supportive fire and movement.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The <font color=\"blue\">fire</font> element is usually equipped with light\n      machine guns or squad automatic weapons to lay down high volumes of fire.\n      The FTL, also in the blue team, is equipped with a rangefinder, for\n      spotting and fire guidance, and a grenade launcher, for indirect fire and\n      laying of smoke cover. The job of the FTL is to enable the movement of the\n      maneuver element via the aforementioned principle of suppression: make it\n      hard for the enemy to do things by applying accurate AR firepower, choice\n      use of explosives, and obscuring their vision with smoke.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The <font color=\"red\">maneuver</font> element is made up of three\n      general-purpose Riflemen, whose job is to advance under cover from the\n      blue team and either suppress or destroy the enemy. One of the Riflemen is\n      carrying an AT launcher of some sort. The launcher is deployed by the red\n      team, since they are generally more flexible and mobile for getting into\n      position to engage enemy armor.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The elements of the fireteam are thus set up to follow the basic\n      principles of Fire and Maneuver: Fire enables Maneuver, which enables\n      Fire, which then enables Maneuver... also known as{\" \"}\n      <b>Bounding Overwatch</b>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <b>Bounding Overwatch</b> is the most often used method of movement\n      through contested territory: One team stands still and provides cover\n      (whether by shooting, or just by being ready to shoot), while the other\n      moves forward.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <b>Successive Bounding Overwatch</b> is achieved when the cover element\n      halts, the move element advances, and then halts, and the cover element\n      moves up to join them, before repeating the drill. This type of movement\n      is slower, but is relatively safe, and can be performed by almost any two\n      elements. This is the type of movement the FTL should use to move their\n      team around.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      <b>Alternating Bounding Overwatch</b> is achieved when instead of joining\n      the move element, the fire element continues moving past them, in essence\n      trading roles. This type of movement is faster, but somewhat more\n      dangerous. This is the type of movement the Squad Leader (SL) should use\n      with each of their fireteams, as they both have the firepower needed to\n      provide cover for the other element.\n    </p>\n  </TTIPLayout>\n)\n\nexport default ThePlatoon\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
