Please use SideChat for questions and\r\n        banter.\r\n      </li>\r\n\r\n      <li>\r\n        Briefing: During this phase please don't talk on TS and listen carefully\r\n        to the CO's instructions. Please use SideChat for banter. Importantly,\r\n        we don't plan by committee: critiques and alternative plans belong in\r\n        the session's AAR thread.\r\n      </li>\r\n\r\n      <li>\r\n        In-Game: Simply remember that one person's witty banter can be another's\r\n        frustrating distraction. Some banter on VON is fine, but if an element\r\n        leader asks you to hush for a bit, please do so.\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>That seems reasonable. What about during gameplay?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      If you do only one thing, simply to follow the orders of your element\r\n      leader and avoid lone-wolfing. Beyond that, we like to respect the design\r\n      of each scenario and play the parts we have selected during slotting:\r\n      unless ordered to, please don't scavenge for fancy/different weapons or\r\n      vehicles not relevant to your role. Non-regulation gear tends to attract\r\n      friendly fire and falling submarines.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>What?!?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Nevermind. Just follow the etiquette and keep the banter to chat during\r\n      planning.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>Is, uh, is there an etiquette guide for banter?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Just one rule: please don't use humour that is at the expense of any group\r\n      of people, be it defined by gender, race, sexual orientation, nationality,\r\n      political views etc. At FA, everyone is welcome - because we all strive to\r\n      ensure nobody feels unwelcome. We're sure you already know that outright\r\n      sexism, racism, homophobia etc. are unacceptable here (as in many\r\n      communities) - we just ask that when you crack a joke or make a witty\r\n      comment, you consider first whether it will make someone feel unwelcome.\r\n      If your remark boils down to 'lol, gay'/'lol, swedes'/'lol, rape', then\r\n      it's just not our kind of banter. This applies not only to 'Banter'\r\n      banter, but to any and all FA comms channels, be it forums, Discord, or\r\n      party-approved carrier pigeons.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>\r\n        But what if me and my friend have this in-joke that s/he doesn't find\r\n        offensive at all, even though it's about Swedes and Australians and sex?\r\n        Isn't this all a bit Social Justice Warrior?\r\n      </b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Remember that anyone can participate in our sessions - new comrades might\r\n      not understand that you're friends, and may feel uncomfortable enough not\r\n      to come back - which would be a shame for you, them and everyone who works\r\n      hard to make the sessions happen. This isn't about politics for us, it's\r\n      about ensuring that FA is a community where absolutely anyone can come and\r\n      enjoy some tactical ArmA. Even sex-loving Swedes and Australians.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>\r\n        Ah ... yeah, that makes sense now that you put it that way. So what\r\n        happens if someone says something that makes me uncomfortable?\r\n      </b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Contact any of the hosts and they'll do all they can to resolve the\r\n      situation. Hopefully without having to use a Party-issued Makarov.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>So, basically, don't be a dick?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>Basically.</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>Anything else I should know?</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      I am glad you asked!
